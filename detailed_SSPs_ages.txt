!# File used by default by code "SSPs" to compute the variable time-step between 
!# consecutive `time_SSP` -- the ages at which the properties of SSPs are output.
!# It provides the parameter `base_time_step` and, for `j` >= 2, two sequences 
!# of numbers, `time(j)` and `factor(j)`.
!# `base_time_step` is also the value used by code "spectra" for the 
!# convolution of the star formation rate with the outputs of "SSPs".
!#
!# `time_SSP(1)` and `time(1)` are automatically set to 0.
!# `time(j)` must be a strictly increasing sequence.
!# If 
!#      `time(j)` <=  `time_SSP(i)` < `time(j+1)`, 
!# then
!#      `time_SSP(i+1)` = `time_SSP(i)` + `factor(j)`*`base_time_step`.
!# 
!# This file should not be modified.
!# To use other values of `base_time_step` and of the sequences `time` and 
!# `factor`, create a file with the same format and add its name on a new line
!# at the end of "list_SSPs_ages.txt".

!# Format:

!# * `j`-th non-comment line (`j` >= 2): 
!#   * `time(j)` (real) in Myr;
!#   * `factor(j)` (integer > 0).
